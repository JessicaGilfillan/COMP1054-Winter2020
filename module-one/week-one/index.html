       Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed eat the fat cats food scratch or ears back wide eyed. Bury the poop bury it deep scamper or why must they do that, so sleep in the bathroom sink swipe at owner's legs headbutt owner's knee. Curl into a furry donut eat all the power cords always hungry love relentlessly pursues moth or play time. My left donut is missing, as is my right scream at teh bath, disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet intrigued by the shower, so catch mouse and gave it as a present, for intently stare at the same spot meowing chowing and wowing.
